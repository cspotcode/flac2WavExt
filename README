flac2WavExt is a Game Maker extension with one function:
    convertFlacToWav(flacFilename, wavFilename)
It reads a flac file from disc and outputs a wav file to disc.  Game Maker does not support compressed formats like flac, but it can easily load and use a wav file.

This DLL is hacked together and rough around the edges.  There's no point in polishing it unless it ends up being used in Gang Garrison 2.

99.99% of this code is the totally unmodified flac source code, available from http://flac.sourceforge.net/.  As such, the license is identical.
